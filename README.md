# Professional README Generator 

## About The Project

This is a command-line application that generates a high-quality README.md file for a user's repository. The application prompts the user for information about their project, including the title, description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, test instructions, license, GitHub username, and email address.

The generated README.md file includes the following sections:

### Description
This section includes the project's title and a brief description of the project.

### Table of Contents
This section includes links to the various sections of the README, including Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions.

## Getting Started

In order to acess this project, just visit the following webpage: [https://github.com/andrewbreytenbach/professional-readme-generator](https://github.com/andrewbreytenbach/professional-readme-generator)

To get a local copy up and running, clone the repo locally and get to work. This way you can change any questions or aspects of the README prompts. 

## Usage

The first image the user will see upon opening VS Code and opening an the folder is this:

![Start Page](/images/StartPage.png "Start Page")

In order to run the file, the user will need to open an integrated terminal and run 'node index.js' in the command line: 

![Terminal](/images/terminal.png "Terminal")

Once the user does that, they will be presented with a series of prompts, each one corresponding to a section of the future README. The user will need to type the desired information in the command line, then hit 'enter' to be taken to the next prompt.

![Prompts](/images/prompts.png "Prompts")

Once the user comes to the end of the prompts, this is what they will see:

![End Prompts](/images/EndPrompts.png "End Prompts")

Once all of the prompts have been entered, a new markdown file has been created and the user is able to click on it and see all of their information inside of it:

![New README](/images/newREADME.png "New README")
